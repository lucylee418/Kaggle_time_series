    "1) **Deseasonalizing** : Trend and seasonality will both create serial dependence that shows up in correlograms and lag plots. To isolate any purely cyclic behavior, we'll start by *deseasonalizing* the series.\n",
    "2) **moving-average plot** using original data : To confirm our intuition, we can try to isolate cyclic behavior using a *moving-average plot* just like we did with trend. The idea is to choose a window long enough to smooth over short-term seasonality, but short enough to still preserve the cycles."
