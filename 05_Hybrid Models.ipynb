    "* This difference is what motivates the hybrid design in this lesson: use linear regression to extrapolate the trend, transform the target to remove the trend, and apply XGBoost to the detrended residuals. To hybridize a neural net (a feature transformer), you could instead include the predictions of another model as a feature, which the neural net would then include as part of its own predictions. The method of fitting to residuals is actually the same method the gradient boosting algorithm uses, so we will call these boosted hybrids; the method of using predictions as features is known as \"stacking\", so we will call these stacked hybrids."
